                abstract: "We examine barriers to - and market-based solutions for - adopting durable and sustainable technologies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), focusing on lithium-ion batteries for electric three-wheelers in Bangladesh. Despite clear environmental and private benefits, lithium-ion batteries hold a minimal market share, with the market dominated by short-lived lead-acid batteries whose recycling generates severe lead pollution. An incentivized field experiment and surveys show that low trust in manufacturers’ claims, along with financial constraints and other factors that reduce the value of future battery use (e.g., high salvage value, high business uncertainty), depress willingness to pay for durable batteries and limit the effectiveness of warranties and related services. We find that product-specific loans from local financial institutions act as credible signals of durability beyond relaxing financial constraints, especially when loan terms align with claimed lifespans. These loans raise willingness to pay for lithium-ion batteries above viable market prices and substantially reduce projected lead-acid battery use, preventing more than 7,500 tons of lead waste in the first year. The results highlight credit design as a key lever for technology adoption in LMICs and a broader role of microfinance in addressing market failures where government regulation or nonprofit support is limited.",

                title: "Multi-Task Learning for Customer Base Analysis: Evidence from a Thousand Companies",
                abstract: "Modeling customer-base activity is inherently a multi-objective problem. It requires understanding how many customers will be acquired over time, how many repeat purchases they will make, and how much they will spend per purchase (“upstream” prediction objectives), as well as how these behaviors aggregate into cohort- and company-level sales (“downstream” objectives). Many other empirical settings also present applied researchers with the challenge of modeling multiple processes alongside downstream outcomes that emerge from them. This paper introduces a flexible and unified generative multi-task learning framework tailored for panel data: the customer-based multi-task transformer (CBMT). The CBMT is designed to jointly project upstream and downstream outcomes. Our methodology balances generalization and specialization by leveraging commonalities across upstream customer behavior processes through shared layers, while enabling tailored predictions for each process via task-specific layers. By employing a multi-objective loss function that explicitly incorporates downstream objectives as auxiliary tasks, we achieve the “best of both worlds”: accurate predictions for each upstream outcome and strong goodness of fit for downstream outcomes. We validate the model using a unique dataset of approximately one thousand companies observed over a 37-month period. The CBMT significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving higher predictive accuracy than 14 benchmark models across all upstream and downstream outcomes. For example, CBMT lowers company-level revenue prediction error by 34% to 65% over a temporal holdout period. We further provide insights into the drivers of this outperformance and examine conditions under which the model performs relatively better or worse through an ablation study and a heterogeneity analysis.",

                abstract: "Do targeted school nutrition bans generate spillover effects on retail purchases that reinforce or undermine their intended health objectives? We investigate this question by examining the 2011 flavored milk ban (affecting products such as chocolate milk) implemented by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). Using Nielsen retail scanner data and synthetic control methods, we estimate the spillover effects of this flavored milk ban on retail beverage purchases outside schools. We address three key questions: First, does the ban change retail purchases of the flavored milk? Second, does the ban generate unintended product substitution toward other beverages? Third, how do effects, if any, change when the ban is reversed? Our results show that the flavored milk ban decreased retail purchases by 8% within LAUSD boundaries, suggesting policy reinforcement. The ban did not significantly affect plain milk or soda consumption but led to a temporary 4.3% increase in juice purchases. The ban’s repeal five years later produced no significant behavioral changes. Additional analyses show effects were driven by negative publicity rather than product displacement. Moreover, increased juice consumption temporarily offset sugar reduction benefits outside schools, and protein intake decreased by 4.8%, revealing complex spillover effects with important policy and managerial implications.",
